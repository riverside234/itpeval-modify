* The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Finally we can prove the fundamental theorem of calculus and its most
important corollaries, which are the main tools to formalize most of
real analysis.

Section FTC.

** The FTC

We can now prove our main theorem.  We begin by remarking that the
primitive function is always continuous.

%\begin{convention}% Assume that [J : interval], [F : PartIR] is
continuous in [J] and [x0] is a point in [J].  Denote by [G] the
indefinite integral of [F] from [x0].
%\end{convention}%

** Corollaries

With these tools in our hand, we can prove several useful results.

%\begin{convention}% From this point onwards:
 - [J : interval];
 - [f : nat->PartIR] is a sequence of continuous functions (in [J]);
 - [F : PartIR] is continuous in [J].

%\end{convention}%

In the first place, if a sequence of continuous functions converges
then the sequence of their primitives also converges, and the limit
commutes with the indefinite integral.

We need to prove this result first for compact intervals.

%\begin{convention}% Assume that [a, b, x0 : IR] with [(f n)] and [F]
continuous in [[a,b]], $x0\in[a,b]$#x0&isin;[a,b]#; denote by
[(g n)] and [G] the indefinite integrals respectively of [(f n)] and

(**
Similar results hold for the sequence of derivatives of a converging sequence; this time the proof is easier, as we can do it directly for any kind of interval.
