# Liouville's theorem

This file contains a proof of Liouville's theorem stating that all Liouville numbers are
transcendental.

To obtain this result, there is first a proof that Liouville numbers are irrational and two
technical lemmas.  These lemmas exploit the fact that a polynomial with integer coefficients
takes integer values at integers.  When evaluating at a rational number, we can clear denominators
and obtain precise inequalities that ultimately allow us to prove transcendence of
Liouville numbers.

/-- A Liouville number is a real number `x` such that for every natural number `n`, there exist
`a, b ∈ ℤ` with `1 < b` such that `0 < |x - a/b| < 1/bⁿ`.
In the implementation, the condition `x ≠ a/b` replaces the traditional equivalent `0 < |x - a/b|`.

/-- Let `Z, N` be types, let `R` be a metric space, let `α : R` be a point and let
`j : Z → N → R` be a function.  We aim to estimate how close we can get to `α`, while staying
in the image of `j`.  The points `j z a` of `R` in the image of `j` come with a "cost" equal to
`d a`.  As we get closer to `α` while staying in the image of `j`, we are interested in bounding
the quantity `d a * dist α (j z a)` from below by a strictly positive amount `1 / A`: the intuition
is that approximating well `α` with the points in the image of `j` should come at a high cost.  The
hypotheses on the function `f : R → R` provide us with sufficient conditions to ensure our goal.
The first hypothesis is that `f` is Lipschitz at `α`: this yields a bound on the distance.
The second hypothesis is specific to the Liouville argument and provides the missing bound
involving the cost function `d`.

This lemma collects the properties used in the proof of `exists_pos_real_of_irrational_root`.
It is stated in more general form than needed: in the intended application, `Z = ℤ`, `N = ℕ`,
`R = ℝ`, `d a = (a + 1) ^ f.nat_degree`, `j z a = z / (a + 1)`, `f ∈ ℤ[x]`, `α` is an irrational
root of `f`, `ε` is small, `M` is a bound on the Lipschitz constant of `f` near `α`, `n` is
the degree of the polynomial `f`.
