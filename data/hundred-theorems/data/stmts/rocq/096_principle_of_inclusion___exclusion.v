 Short proof of the inclusion-exclusion principle, which gives the
 cardinality of a finite union of finite sets as an alternating sum of
 cardinalities of the intersections of those sets.

 We choose a formalization of finite sets particularly well suited for
 our purposes: [X] is the universe, or support, of the base sets. We
 suppose the union is finite, and hence we assume a list [enum_X] to
 enumerate all the elements that are in all the considered sets.  In
 fact, we only use [enum_X] to define a constructive [cardinal]
 function, so if enum_X happens to enumerate some elements several
 times, the theorem still holds, which means that it also works if the
 cardinality is "weighted".
 
 Finally, the finiteness of the set of sets is enforced by using a
 list of sets, in which we do not require each set to be unique, so
 the inclusion-exclusion principle also works for a multiset of sets.
